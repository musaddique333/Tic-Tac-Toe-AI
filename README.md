## About the Project

This project implements a classic TIC TAC TOE game with an AI opponent. It's built using Python and the Pygame library to provide a graphical user interface.

## What I Learned üß†

Throughout the development of this TIC TAC TOE AI project, I gained valuable knowledge and practical experience in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), including:

1. **Minimax Algorithm** ü§ñ: I implemented the minimax algorithm to create a strategic AI opponent for TIC TAC TOE, learning about its principles and application in game development.

2. **AI Evaluation and Decision-Making** üßæ: I developed skills in evaluating game states and making optimal AI decisions using the minimax algorithm, enhancing my understanding of AI decision trees and game theory.

3. **Game Development with Pygame** üéÆ: I leveraged the Pygame library to create a graphical user interface, gaining experience in game development, user interaction, and rendering game elements.

4. **Python Programming and Data Structures** üêç: I honed my Python programming skills, including working with data structures, loops, and conditionals in the context of game development.

5. **Game Development Principles** üéØ: I developed a deeper understanding of game development principles, including game states, user interaction, and game logic.

## Requirements üì¶

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python**: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. If not, you can download and install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Pygame Library**: You'll need the Pygame library. You can install it using pip:

  ```bash
  pip install pygame
### Getting Started üöÄ

#### Clone the Repository

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/musaddique333/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI.git

## Features

- Choose between Player versus Player (PvP) and Player versus AI (PvAI) modes.
- The AI opponent offers different levels of difficulty.
- The game is built using Pygame, providing a visual and interactive user interface.

## Gameplay

- In PvAI mode, you can choose between various AI difficulty levels:
  - Random AI: The AI makes random moves.
  - Intelligent AI: The AI uses a minimax algorithm to play strategically.
- In PvP mode, you can play against a friend on the same device.

## How to Play

1. Use the `g` key to toggle between PvAI and PvP modes.
2. In PvAI mode:
   - Press `0` to switch to the Random AI.
   - Press `1` to switch to the Intelligent AI.
3. To reset the game, press `r`.
